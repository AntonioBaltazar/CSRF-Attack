CSRF Vulnerability Demonstration - Website
This project has been created to demonstrate CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability. The website is divided into two parts: Unprotected and Protected.

Unprotected
In the "Unprotected" section, we highlight the CSRF vulnerability by simulating an attack. When the user clicks on a pop-up at the bottom of the screen, they are redirected to a malicious page (evil.html) that executes a form to change the password. A button is included to inform the user that they have been redirected to a malicious page.

Demo:

- Access the "Unprotected" page of the site.
- Click on the pop-up at the bottom of the screen to be redirected to "evil.html."
- Observe the password change without user confirmation.


Protected
In the "Protected" section, we use the same page as in the "Unprotected" version but this time there is an anti-CSRF token assigned to the user's session. The malicious pop-up can no longer successfully execute a password change request without the appropriate CSRF token.

Demo:

- Access the "Protected" page of the site.
- Click on the pop-up at the bottom of the screen to be redirected to "evil.html."
- Note that the password change form fails due to the absence of the CSRF token.
